Logistic regression is a commonly used technique for solving binary classification problems. In a logistic regression model:

we take linear combination (or weighted sum of the input features)
we apply the sigmoid function to the result to obtain a number between 0 and 1
this number represents the probability of the input being classified as "Yes"
instead of RMSE, the cross entropy loss function is used to evaluate the results
Here's a visual summary of how a logistic regression model is structured (source):


To train a logistic regression model, we can use the LogisticRegression class from Scikit-learn. We covered the following topics in this tutorial:

Downloading a real-world dataset from Kaggle
Exploratory data analysis and visualization
Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets
Filling/imputing missing values in numeric columns
Scaling numeric features to a

 range
Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
Training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
Evaluating a model using a validation set and test set
Saving a model to disk and loading it back
